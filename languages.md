# Rants against languages

## Python
- Damn you Python for not having a default event-loop system that allows developers using async/await with ease
- I don't want to check every time if a key exists in a dict!

## Javascript
- It's too damn difficult passing JS code between workers/processes (serialize/deserialize sucks!)
